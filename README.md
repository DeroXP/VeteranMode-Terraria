# IMPORTANT NOTICE!
As of February 27, 2024, Veteran Mode is back in full development, and the release of the first version is approaching sooner than expected. The collaboration between developers DeroVB and Maxhax64 is at its peak, bringing Veteran Mode closer to reality. We will keep you informed in case of any personal or development blocks hindering progress.

The code in the main repository, as of February 27, 2024, remains unchanged. It will now be regularly updated to reflect the ongoing progress of Veteran Mode as it approaches the first release. Several months ago, we initiated a full reset of Veteran Mode. Currently, we are well past catching up and are incorporating significant advancements in code, pixelation, and overall management. It's essential to note that this project is managed by only two developers, and while this might slow down the pace compared to larger teams, we've chosen to keep it small due to the strong bond between our team members. This decision may be subject to change in the future, but for now, we're committed to maintaining a tight-knit team.

Get ready for the full-scale development of Veteran Mode starting February 27, 2024.

The code will be revealed only upon release and for subsequent patched updates. We prefer not to expose the code during pre-release development to minimize the risk of theft, safeguarding over a year's worth of work. However, we'll provide frequent updates on features, fixes, and tests in the update-log.txt file. We aim to be transparent and straightforward in our development, not making promises that haven't already been fulfilled. Changes in development may occur, so please stay updated if you're interested in this project. As of now, the only assurance we can provide is that Veteran Mode will be treated with thought and care, and it will be released when fully prepared, undergoing extensive testing in all areas to ensure player satisfaction.

# Veteran Mode
The overarching theme of Veteran Mode centers around the extreme challenges players face in the environment. Enemies and bosses (excluding friendly NPCs) will exhibit drastic enhancements in difficulty, with increased life regeneration, health, damage, defense, and speed. To counterbalance this difficulty, we're in the process of creating items and assets to aid players, such as boss armors and summoners. Immunity frames have been completely removed for an even more challenging experience. Only one boss will be added to this Mod until the next release, and we will provide the source code on GitHub for those interested in exploring and creating mods and addons for Veteran Mode. If you decide to use our code, please credit the developers by linking to this repository in your mod/addon description, even if you've made modifications.

# Our Policies
We don't ask for much, but if you encounter any bugs, whether game-breaking or not, please contact the developers or submit them in the issues section of this repository. We'll work swiftly to address and fix these issues to ensure a playable and enjoyable Veteran Mode experience. If you have any complaints about aspects added by our project, inform the developers, and we'll review your feedback. If deemed appropriate, we'll either remove the feature or improve it to enhance your Veteran Mode experience. Please be patient, as fixes may not be immediate.

Regarding the use of our assets, including code, sprites, etc., we request proper crediting. Simply copy the text from the "Credit" section below in this README.md file and paste it into your description, including a link to this repository, developers' usernames, and the project's name. You don't need to craft this text yourself, but your cooperation in acknowledging our work is appreciated.
