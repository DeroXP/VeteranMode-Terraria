# VeteranMode-Terraria
Veteran mode is an extra difficulty that is harder than Master mode. It takes all bosses damage and health and doubles it, and adds 5-10 defense to every boss as well. In reward of killing a boss, you earn special items like staffs and accessories that are basically summons of that boss and they fight with you in unique ways.
