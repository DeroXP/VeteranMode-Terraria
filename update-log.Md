so first of all hypothermia, hyperthermia is working alright 
just a few bugs and its perfect :+1:

also most or all this text will probably be from me DeroVB

I'm pretty lazy to change all of the code in the main directory so new 
release of VeteranModes Source code today at March 1, 2024 1:35 PM

New release for this folder file today don't know how many more releases
will come out because of the project risk of being stolen or leaked so
we will stop sharing the process of this masterpiece of a mod after
maybe version 0.4 or more after that like 0.6 but for now we aren't
even close to that so it will be fine.

Also link : https://github.com/DeroXP/VeteranMode-Terraria/releases/tag/0.0.9.4

Now let's talk about some problems so first of all hyper/hypo seems to 
be bugged but no worries easy fix coming soon enough and will be asking
Maxhax64 for new ideas for our mod and maybe he will become the
artist for our assets because before reboot i did all of them
but i need to focus on code even though i am an artist.

So at March 1, 2024 3:26 PM I have added blood splatters super dope.

and now added randomized multiplied speed for eneimes

pretty sure hyper/hypo is fixed, 0.1.0.0 soon enough basically is
all mechanics are done well basic mechanics.

added pinkslime splatter to pinky and got rid of warnings so better code
performance too.

Testing for now might stop for a while will come back tho

hyper/hypo is set to a liking to me so it works great i hate how the
word "liking" looks it just looks link and dumb

holy shit i had too do so damn much after that last update but basically
i had to tweak hyper and hypo because it only worked in Desert Biome
but now it works in all and few more lemme check rq, oh i also fixed
the particle splatters to be better and makes sure deaths work because
of a glitch from the thermia's that wont kill you just keep you at zero
so made sure to kill the player also with funny death reasons some boring
some not will add a config to turn on and off dark humor

Source code may get to big so i'll try to make it accessible without having
to download it.
